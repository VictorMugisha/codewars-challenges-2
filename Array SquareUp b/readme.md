Description:
This is a question from codingbat

Given a non-negative integer `n`,
create and return an array with the following pattern:
```javascript
squareUp(3) => [0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1]
squareUp(2) => [0, 1, 2, 1]
squareUp(4) => [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 1, 0, 3, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1]
0 <= n <= 1 000
```
